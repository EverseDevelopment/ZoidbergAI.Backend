# Zoidberg AI - Backend

This deploys a Google Cloud Function that serves as the backend for the Zoidberg AI assistant in Revit. It generates code to solve different user requirements that the assistant later runs.

If you appreciate the work put into this free tutorial, please leave us a comment on YouTube/Substack.

## Getting Started

For local running, you can use `yarn start`. That will spin up a local server with the endpoint running in `http://localhost:8080/`. Otherwise, deploy this to your GCP account using your deployment keys (check out the tutorial for more info).
